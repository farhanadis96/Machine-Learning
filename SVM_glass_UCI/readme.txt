Files to run:

ovo.py - contains code for one vs one svm classification for all four kernels.
ovr.py - contains code for one vs all svm classification for all four kernels.
weighted.py - contains code for weighted svm classification for all four kernels.

All the three .py files read 'uci_dataset.csv' file as input.

ovo_all_acc.txt - contains the accuracies for all the hyperparameters' values tested for one vs one procedure to determine the optimal hyperparameters.
ovr_all_acc.txt - contains the accuracies for all the hyperparameters' values tested for one vs all procedure to determine the optimal hyperparameters.
weighted_all_acc - contains the accuracies for all the hyperparameters' values tested for weighted procedure to determine the optimal hyperparameters.
